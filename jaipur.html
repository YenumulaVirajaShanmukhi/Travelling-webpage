    <h1>2.Jaipur</h1>
    <p>Jaipur, <strong>the capital city of Rajasthan in India</strong>, is renowned 
       for its rich cultural heritage, majestic palaces, and vibrant traditions.
        Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur is often referred 
       to as the "Pink City" due to the predominant color of its buildings in 
       the old city. The city is a splendid blend of history and modernity, 
       with attractions like the City Palace, Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds), 
       and the Jantar Mantar observatory, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
        Jaipur is also famous for its bustling bazaars, where one can shop for 
        traditional handicrafts, textiles, and jewelry. The city's lively festivals, 
        such as the Jaipur Literature Festival and Teej, further showcase its vibrant 
        cultural tapestry. With its architectural marvels, cultural richness, and 
        warm hospitality, Jaipur continues to captivate visitors from around the globe.
